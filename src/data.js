    For $1,749, you get a laptop that's got virtually no bezels, a powerful 10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, a speedy SSD, a lovely display, over 12 hours of battery life, a comfy keyboard and surprisingly good audio, all in an elegant chassis that's 2% smaller than its predecessor.
    
    However, if you're looking for something with longer battery life, you'll want to consider the $1,313 HP Spectre x360 13-inch. Need more power? The MSI Prestige 14 might be more your speed. But if you're looking for the total package, the Dell XPS 13 is the laptop for you.`

But if you were one of the few out there who has been clamoring for a follow-up to 2017’s Pixelbook, the Go didn’t quite meet the mark.
    Enter Samsung. At CES earlier this year, the company showed off the stunning Galaxy Chromebook, a computer that really does feel like a successor to the original Pixelbook. Amenities include a gorgeous 4K touchscreen, a stowable pen, lots of storage and processing power, and an sleek, all-metal enclosure. And you can’t miss it in that bold red color. On paper, it’s a capable and well-designed computer, easily one of the best Chromebooks on the market.`
